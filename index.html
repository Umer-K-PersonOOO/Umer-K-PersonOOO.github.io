      <h2 class="problem">Problem #1: The Shell</h2>
      <!--Lighter font, bigger size, more line spacing-->
      <p>Most research software still runs on a shell program from the 1980s. User-friendliness was never a priority of bash, but researchers still have to use it daily.</p>

      <h2 class="problem">Problem #2: The Code</h2>
      <p>Coding skills are a huge roadblock for scientists looking to transition into computational, data-driven research. Intelligent people have intelligent ideas that they struggle to convey to a machine.</p>

      <h2 class="problem">Problem #3: The Packaging</h2>
      <p>Software developers struggle to package their code for cross-platform distribution, and their users struggle with installation and environment setup. Too much time is wasted just getting programs to run.</p>
